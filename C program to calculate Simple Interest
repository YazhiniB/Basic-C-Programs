//Write and execute a C program to calculate Simple Interest. Given principal (amount), time and interest rate and we have to calculate simple interest based on given rate of given time period. 
Formula to calculate simple interest: (principal x rate x time)/100 In this program, variable amount is going to be used to store principal amount, rate is going to be used to store interest rate 
and time is going to be used to store time and si is going to be used to store simple interest.

include <stdio.h>
include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
float amount,rate,si; 
float time;
scanf("%f %f %f",&amount,&rate,&time); 
si = (amount*rate*time)/100;
printf("The Simple Interest is: %f",si);
}
